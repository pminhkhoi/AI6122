      "Hiya all, I began putting together a Stochastic Simulation to explore this, and slowly it developed into a full-fledged side-project that I worked on occasionally alongside my PhD. Started LoL in Season 2 and have been consuming some flavour of Lol Esports since around then (the first match I watched was the CLG-EU vs M5 70min). I have never posted on Reddit before, but I wanted to share my work properly (even if between moving home and getting internet it's now about 2 weeks late). irl name is Jordan, and the account was just made to contribute my project to the community. Github link to view the full notebook https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave. Might put together a companion video explaining more and my thoughts as it's pretty hard to communicate everything here. I've linked the specific images where needed, and I will mark areas of cut content in brackets. An extra disclaimer before we start. The data isn't cleverly scraped, this project isn't perfect and the process is not as detailed as it could be. Even so, I am confident the method used provides a well-made stochastic simulation that meaningfully represents the format. I have done my utmost to outline my assumptions and justify my process below.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "For the 2023 world championship, Riot updated their Groups stage from 4 groups of 4 teams with a double round robin within each group, to a Swiss stage. It is natural as a Western fan to ask what impact this might have for Western teams, as we typically perform better in volatile formats (such as the previous 'best of one' double round robin groups stage). We look to construct a stochastic simulation to investigate the new tournament system implemented by Riot.\n",
      "Previous Tournament(s) for data\n",
      "\n",
      "(Cut content explaining Major/Minor Regions) Throughout its history, League of Legends has had 4 primary international events. Worlds, the Mid-Season Invitational, Asian Games, and All-Stars. The All-Stars tournament is an off-season international tournament featuring fan-voted players, and was last seen in 2020 and will not be used in the data set. The Asian Games is an internationally recognised competition between countries that choose six players and coaching staff to send as their representatives. While League of Legends is used, it is not an exclusively Riot Games event. While it is a hyper-competitive event, players who play for one Region at Worlds or MSI may play for their home country's team in the Asian Games. Therefore as these teams do not represent those that would have had to fight through their regional league to be seeded into Worlds or MSI, and there are significant differences in how these teams are constructed, we will also be excluding the Asian Games from our data set. We therefore will only be considering the Mid-Season Invitational and Worlds matches as valid observations. The main issue we face is that as there are different numbers of representatives from different regions sent to each tournament, observations between the strongest seeds (Korea/China 1st seeds) and the weakest seeds (minor regions who struggle to make it to the main stage) are extremely limited / completely unobserved. As such, our first and most important assumption is that we will be measuring each Region's strength, rather than the strength of each region's seed individually (for example we will treat the 3rd seed of Europe the same as their 1st seed). In addition to increasing the pool of observations between different regions, this allows us a much simpler way to tackle changes in regions and regional construction throughout history.\n",
      "Blue-Team Advantage and Side Selection\n",
      "\n",
      "Blue has long been considered the stronger team and is chosen most often over the history of professional play. Typically the higher seed going into a match gets side selection in the first match (if the match is a best of 3 or 5), or teams will get to play once on both sides (in the double round robin mentioned above). The other way a team will have to choose a side is when they lose a match in a best of 3 or 5. We will calculate a global prior of Blue vs Red win chance, update the win chance for each region, and give whoever has side selection the choice of the better side for their region in the given circumstance.\n",
      "Data and League History\n",
      "\n",
      "(Cut content explaining that Metas changed, and explaining the different leagues). Some cut-off for the original seasons of League's history is required, as many of the institutions that now support teams in each region did not exist in the early years. I have chosen 2014 as the cut-off, so only data from season 5 (2015) and later will be considered. The precise cut-off does not have much justification, and there is an argument for formal analysis to see if there is a significant difference in the win rates of different teams around these years, however there is a lot of expert knowledge that would need to be provided to justify a specific cut-off date, and a rough estimate of 2015 seems satisfactory. The question is what to do with Oceania and Turkey? We can either re-classify their previous teams as they would appear in their new region, or we can remove them. Turkey is now a tier two region inside the LEC and as such none of their teams will be representing the LEC at Worlds. Further, the best performing Oceanian team placed 7/8th in the PCS, which implies the quality of Oceanian teams does not suitably represent the PCS, and as such both Regions should be excluded beyond calculating historic Blue advantage for our Prior.\n",

      "(I've done my best to get the little bit of stats across but I can't find a good way to put latex equations in a Reddit post :( ) As we can see from the data, there are some Regions which have NEVER won a match against another region. Obviously, they have some chance, even if the data we have observed doesn't include a win. As such, we're going to take a Bayesian approach and look to construct a posterior distribution for the probability a Region wins on blue. We can take the Maximum Posterior estimate probabilities as a win-chance for our simulation of the Swiss Stage. We could either model each game following the Bernoulli distribution, since whether a team wins or loses is a simple binary outcome, or we could model full matches following the Binomial Distribution. Since the Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the Binomial distribution, and therefore the Beta distribution can be used as a conjugate for both, there is minimal practical difference (as long as any side selection assumption is valid). Hence, as whoever wins each game determines side selection, it will be much simpler if we take the first approach. We assume that the probability a Region i wins a given match on Blue when against another Region j on Red is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution ω~Bern(p). Second, we need to construct our prior distribution for the chance any Region wins on Blue. We know that the win rate Blue should roughly be 56%, and that this is going to depend a lot on the quality of the team more so than this prior information. Therefore, we want a relatively flat Beta distribution with an expected value E[X] = 0.56. The expected value of the Beta distribution is given by E[x] = a/(a+b). As a Beta(1,1) is equivalent to a Uniform distribution over [0,1], and a Beta(2,2) is a parabola centred on 0.5, we choose a prior distribution of Beta(1.4,1.1) (https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave/blob/main/Reddit%20Post/BetaDist.png). This gives a Posterior Probability for the chance a team wins vs any other region on both Blue and Red sides (See the Array here https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave/blob/main/Reddit%20Post/Individual%20Win%20Odds.png).\n",

      "(Removed description of previous groups format) We need to test a simulation with the old Format to check our method isn't absurd, which is a typical test to run when constructing a simulation for analysis. The issue is, that some of the regions no longer exist, some existed at different points, and the play-ins seeding is significantly different. Therefore, we're going to make some assumptions and run a test simulation of the old Groups. We want to construct some Pools that are historically accurate, and since I'm a Bias EU fan, let's pick the structure and teams from 2019, where the Pools were:\n",

      "    3) The Groups Pool 3 consisted of the 4 teams advancing from the previous PlayIns structure. As the strongest teams we have available to us on paper (Looking at you MAD Lions), we look to seed in LCK3, LEC3, LCS3 and VCS2 from the historical Play-Ins bracket. In tie-breaker matches, side selection was given to the team with the lower average victory time (https://www.esportsbets.com/league-of-legends/worlds/rules, note: I couldn't find a Riot source here), but as we don't simulate match time, we will decide side selection via a coin flip. This is not a perfect simulation as we are not tracking head-to-head results, which for certain tie-breaker scenarios would create more situations to track, and we're using a simplification here as Worlds is around the corner (29th September 2023) we're almost at the Main stage (17th October 2023).

      "What does our simulation say about the Winner of Worlds?\n",
      "\n",
      "The headline estimate figures under the simulation are that there is an approximate 3% chance any Western team happens to be the one to win Worlds under the previous format, which as over the 8 and a half years of data used no Western team has won Worlds holds up in line with reality. Of the 8 actual winners in the data set, 5 were from South Korea (62.5%) and 3 were from China (37.5%), with the simulation following a similar suit giving China 33.3% of all victories and South Korea 63.5%. Therefore, at least for the overall winner, the simulation appears to be a good historical reflection of reality. Plus, shout-out to the 6/10000 scenarios where the PCS won! (https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave/blob/main/Reddit%20Post/Historic%20Win.png)\n",
      "How about the Runners Up?\n",
      "\n",
      "Collectively we have about a 12% chance of being eliminated as the Runners-up. Historically we've occupied 2/8 (25%) of the runner-up positions, which at first glance makes the simulation appear to be understating the West's ability to reach the Finals. However, considering that there are very few historical observations (only 8 observed runners-up), the simulated results are not an extreme divergence from history, and there is still a strong argument that the simulation is a fair representation of historic events. One could make the argument that one of these 2nd place positions was due to two Western teams meeting in the semi-finals (a very rare event, guaranteeing a Western top two position), and therefore the correct historic percentage should be the number of times a Western team has defeated an Eastern team in the semi-finals (G2 in 2019 is the only historical example, giving 12.5% observed vs 12% simulated estimate). This is not to make a comment on how strong Fnatic 2018 were in comparison to their peers at the time, as some considered them to potentially be the best Western team we had ever sent, and they finished their group as the 1st seed, winning against Invictus Gaming (the eventual winners) in their tie-breaker match. However, if we consider finals match occurrences, rather than winner or runners-up, the historic simulation looks even better justified.\n",
      "Finally (and most importantly), what about the number of scenarios where no one qualifies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Arguably more important is the number of simulated tournaments where no Western team makes it to groups. As the previous analysis looks at the proportion that a team appears in any randomly chosen position independent of other teams, we actually lose implicit information about those very teams. Worlds does not occur in a vacuum, and there are 16 teams all dependent on one another for positions. We see that under the conditions set out the chance no Western team made it to groups is approximately 1%. We also see how the chance of a Western team making it to the Semi-Finals and the Finals drops drastically as the Western teams now have to win a best of 5 (most likely against either China or Korea) to advance. While we appear in nearly 15% of finals (comparative to our 12.5% occupancy rate of total collective finals positions, where the difference occurs when the West has two teams in the Final), the final 3% chance to bring home the Worlds trophy still holds from the beginning of this analysis (https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave/blob/main/Reddit%20Post/Historic%20Appearence%20Chance.png).\n",
      "Old Format Critique - Improved Resolution\n",
      "\n",
      "One significant criticism of the simulation for the historic format is that we no longer live in 2019, we live in 2023. While it is important to test assumptions by simulating the historic structure our data originates from, one cannot claim that the differences between a 2019 structure and the modern 2023 structure are only because of the introduction of the Swiss stage. Therefore we look to simulate a hyperthetical 2023 groups stage to evaluate the impact the introduction of Swiss has had on Western teams. Therefore we will label our previous simulation that looked at a historic format as the 'Historic' simulation, our comparison simulation with a hypothetical bracket 'Swissless', and the final 2023 simulation as \"Swiss\". The important difference between the Historic and Swissless formats is the inclusion of a 4th seeds from the most competitive regions, which as we have identified from the 2019 simulation, will likely have a hugely significant impact on the results as the difference between the proportional 30% of knockouts slots and 99% chance to not miss knockouts is likely to change drastically if there are enough LPL and LCK teams to fill all 8 knockout slots. Therefore, in order to simulate a Swissless Worlds 2023, we look to base the simulation heavily on the 2022 Worlds format, and while the draw rules were slightly different with 4 pools rather than 3 because we do not consider the strength of each seed, it has no impact on the simulation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Worlds 2022 saw 4 LPL teams, 4 LCK teams, 4 LEC teams, 3 LCS teams, 2 PCS, 2 VCS, 1 LLA, 1 LJL, 1 CBL, 1 LCO (Oceania) and 1 TCL (Turkey). For our Swissless simulation, we follow Worlds 2022 with 3 LCK, 3 LPL, 2 LEC, 2 LCS, 1 PCS and 1 VCS teams automatically seeded into the groups stage, and will further seed the 4th LCK and LPL seeds, 3rd LEC and LCS seeds (as those are the teams that passed the 2022 play-ins stage). We see that while we estimated the West to win about 3% of Worlds under the 2019 rules, under a hypothetical Swissless structure we only estimate a chance of 1.4% for a Western team to win the tournament (https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave/blob/main/Reddit%20Post/Swissless%20Win.png). Further, we see how the probability of a Western team appearing at any stage in the knockouts has dropped significantly, with there now being a 10% chance no Western team makes knockouts, and only an approximate 6.8% chance of a Western team making a Finals appearance (https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave/blob/main/Reddit%20Post/Swissless%20Appearence%20Chance.png). As expected China and Korea are effectively guaranteed to appear in the knockout stage, with approximate 91% and 99% odds to make it to semi-finals, and a further 89% and 64% odds respectively to have a team appear in the finals. Ultimately, when considering a deep run at Worlds as a team from the West making it to the finals, the addition of a 4th seed from the LPL and LEC more than halved the Western chance.\n",

However, we will sample the bracket randomly just as Riot has done in order to fully simulate a Worlds run under the current rules. The 8 teams are seeded via two pools into the 2 double elimination brackets where two teams will qualify for the Swiss stage. The Play-Ins conclude with the upper-bracket finalist from one bracket facing off against the lower-bracket finalist from the opposing bracket in a best of 5. Seeding rules that we seed all Pool 1 teams (upper tier), then all Pool 2 (lower tier), where any team from the same Region must be in different brackets, and any team from the same Pool cannot face each other in the first round.\n",

      "Teams in the Swiss stage will always face an opponent with an equivalent scoreline throughout (potentially) 5 rounds. Teams play in a single Bo1 (which has massive implications for the impact of Blue advantage) unless playing in a qualification (to the knockouts) or elimination (lose and you're removed from the tournament) match where they play a Bo3 (https://lolesports.com/article/state-of-the-game-lol-esports-in-2023/blt5d3bca31d1b39e0c). Update 12th Sep 2023: Following the Primer, we now know how the teams are seeded into the Swiss bracket. Seeds 1 must fight a 4th Seed, and a 2nd Seed must fight a 3rd Seed, where seeds 1,2 and 3 are from their respective major regions, and 4th Seeds are LCK4, LPL4 and the two Play-In winners. We need to match the pairs and then randomly allocate these pairs to matches to suitably explore the full state space as a requirement for valid results for a Monte Carlo estimate. Further, throughout the Swiss bracket, side selection is not random as I had first coded up The most challenging part of this is that Riot Games is very tight on information on how the teams will be matched up throughout the bracket. For example, we don't know if a team that wins in round 3 from 1|1 to have a scoreline of 2|1 is equivalent to a team that lost the upper bracket to now be at 2|1. Are these teams treated the same or do we randomly match these teams up? If we do fix the Upper and Middle bracket teams in their own pools, then who gets the higher seed if they win? I've thought it best to randomly sample both the Upper and Lower brackets in round 4, and we will perform an extra random draw step going into the Knockout stage.\n",

      "The headline figure to highlight is that the odds of a Western team winning Worlds have shot up by approximately just over 33% relative to their estimated chances from the Swissless simulation, to a tournament-winning chance of about 2.1%. This gives the West a real-term odds increase of about 0.6% for Worlds 2023, where we see the odds of Korea or China ending up victorious only decline in real terms by about 0.5% each. However, we specifically see the biggest benefit for Europe, with them appearing in roughly 1.5 times the number of victories when compared to the Swissless simulation (https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave/blob/main/Reddit%20Post/Swiss%20Win.png). For runner-up, we observe a similar change, where the Western chance of appearing here increases from approximately 5.4% to 8.3% (54% increase) at the expense of the Eastern teams under the new format. We further observe some impressive Minor region 2nd place finishes within our 10,000 simulated Worlds, implying there are better chances for a Minor region team making a deep run in the new format, although the simulation was not run long enough to make a reliable estimate for the exact percentage chance (https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave/blob/main/Reddit%20Post/Swiss%20Runners%20Up.png). Finally, we observe how the Swiss changes have improved the chances of seeing a Western team make it through to the knockout stage, with the odds of at least one Western team making it out improving from 84.5% to 96.7%, with a further improvement of a Western team making it to finals increasing from 6.8% to 10.24% (approximately a 50% increase) (https://github.com/JordanJHood/StochasticSim-LeagueOfLegends-Worlds2023-WhatImpactWillSwissHave/blob/main/Reddit%20Post/Swiss%20Appearence%20Chance.png).\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "While an extra 1/200 Worlds victories doesn't sound amazing, almost any team would jump at a chance to improve their odds of success by 33%! Meanwhile, while the Eastern teams do see their real-world chance of victory drop by about 0.2-0.5% each, this has only decreased their respective chances of winning Worlds by about 1% compared to their Swissless odds, which only goes to demonstrate the sheer dominance of the Eastern teams in this tournament. There is an interesting question to be answered as to why the Swiss format, which in theory should reward the superior regions (remember their win rate hasn't changed with the new format on a per-game basis) has resulted in a relatively considerable improvement for the Western teams' chances of making a meaningful run? I conjecture that the answer lies in how the Swiss stage is paired up. After the first round, where teams are drawn into matches based on their pools, the teams are then randomly paired with opponents of equal score. As there are likely to be some Korean vs Chinese matches in round 1, it simply takes some occurrence in certain rounds for an LCK or LPL team to be playing one another at both the 0|0, 1|0 and 0|1 scorelines, where the only block for a Western team is potentially to win a best of three. Further, with the West likely to fulfil slots 3 through 8, there will be multiple scenarios where say seed 4 and seed 7, as both Western teams, have the potential to be drawn together. While this is not likely, this scenario is more likely than a Western team in the Swissless structure drawn into say group A placing 1st Seed against both an LCK and LPL team, a Western team in any other group places 2nd seed beating out either their respective LCK or LPL team and both teams being drawn into a Quarter Finals match. I believe the reason for the improved Western odds this year is because as a part of the Swissless environment, with both 4 LCK and 4 LPL teams, every Western team is forced to overcome both a Korean and a Chinese team across 4 matches to obtain a beneficial Quarter-Finals match. This study shows that we can expect the West, which we model as objectively weaker than Chinese and Korean teams, to have a greater chance both to make it to the knockouts thereby eliminating one of those eight teams and making it all the way to the finals match, even winning the tournament. This certainly implies the Swiss format is far more volatile than the Groups system, and whether this is a worse format because of it is up for debate, as one could argue that increasing the possibility of engaging the entire Western fan base by enabling at least one Western team to make it to the Knockout stage is a good system. After all, everybody loves a good underdog storyline. Ultimately, Western fans should be quietly hopeful for one of our representatives to perform better than expected this year based on format changes alone. For anyone who has made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this all. I'm very open to any and all feedback about this project. There is so much more that could be investigated!
